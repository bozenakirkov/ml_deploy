# ml_deploy

It is a repository for deploying ML models and testing poetry, nox, tensorflow, flask, and swagger.

Model is trained using MNIST dataset and recognizes digits **[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]**.

There are two different models:
- model_1
- model_2

Scripts for generating models and test samples are jupyter notebooks: 
- model_1.ipynb
- model_2.ipynb


## **Prerequisites:**

- install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/

- from https://github.com/python-poetry/install.python-poetry.org download install-poetry.py and run it

- install dependencies from pyproject.toml file
(could not install tensorflow https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/48939)

- Install Docker Desktop

- In Docker Desktop - Settings - Kubernetes - check "Enable Kubernetes"

- Move files listed below to **ml_deploy** parent directory:

  - Dockerfile
  - deployment.yaml

- Test the code - in **ml_deploy** directory run:

nox --verbose


## **User Guide:**

- start Docker Desktop.exe

- open cmd as admin

- go to **ml_deploy** parent directory and run:

docker build -t model-deploy .

- verify the image was created:

docker image ls

- run the application in a container and map it to port 5000:

docker run -p 5000:5000 model-deploy

- send the YAML file to Kubernetes:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

- see the pods are running:

kubectl get pods

- tag docker image:

docker image tag model-deploy USER_NAME/model-deploy:latest

- push image to docker hub:

docker image push USER_NAME/model-deploy:latest
